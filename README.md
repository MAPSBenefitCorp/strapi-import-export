# Import export for Strapi 5 (WIP)

- This is a fork of [strapi-import-export](https://github.com/Baboo7/strapi-plugin-import-export-entries) by @Baboo7, but built from scratch starting with this [guide](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/plugins/development/create-a-plugin) to work with Strapi 5 and use the new API.

- Fairly untested, but mostly working

## Done
- **Import** - seems to work okay, but not tested file import, code editor works
- **Export** - works on collections, export to JSON works on full database, but CSV and other deprecated one doesn't
- Admin dashboard components started (converted a lot of the deprecated imports)
- Server stuff converted to ESM so it can be used in Strapi 5
- Removed a lot of typescript because it was causing issues

## TODO
- Check if import from file/csv works
- Convert back to typescript if you want (I don't need this though)
